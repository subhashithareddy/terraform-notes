Data sources:
-------------
Data sources, which are a special type of resource used only for looking up information.


Expressions:
------------
Expressions within a Terraform module can access information about resources in the same module, and you can use that information to help configure other resources. 
Use the <RESOURCE TYPE>.<NAME>.<ATTRIBUTE> syntax to reference a resource attribute in an expression.


Local Resources:
----------------
While most resource types correspond to an infrastructure object type that is managed via a remote network API, t
here are certain specialized resource types that operate only within Terraform itself, 
calculating some results and saving those results in the state for future use.


Meta-arguments:
---------------
The Terraform language defines several meta-arguments, which can be used with any resource type to change the behavior of resources

depends_on --> for specifying hidden dependencies
count --> for creating multiple resource instances according to a count
for_each --> to create multiple instances according to a map, or set of strings
provider --> for selecting a non-default provider configuration
lifecycle --> for lifecycle customizations
provisioner --> for taking extra actions after resource creation
