Modules are collection of .tf files in a directory. Top level configuration files in a directory are only treated as modules.
sub-directories are treated as separate modules.

A Terraform module can use module calls to explicitly include other modules into the configuration
These child modules can come from local directories (nested in the parent module's directory, 
or anywhere else on disk), or from external sources like the Terraform Registry.



meta-arguments:
---------------
The Terraform language defines several meta-arguments, which can be used with any resource type to change the behavior of resources

depends_on --> for specifying hidden dependencies
count --> for creating multiple resource instances according to a count
for_each --> to create multiple instances according to a map, or set of strings
provider --> for selecting a non-default provider configuration
lifecycle --> for lifecycle customizations
provisioner --> for taking extra actions after resource creation
