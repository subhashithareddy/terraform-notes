Modules are collection of .tf files in a directory. Top level configuration files in a directory are only treated as modules.
sub-directories are treated as separate modules.

A Terraform module can use module calls to explicitly include other modules into the configuration
These child modules can come from local directories (nested in the parent module's directory, 
or anywhere else on disk), or from external sources like the Terraform Registry.
