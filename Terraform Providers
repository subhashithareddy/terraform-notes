Provider Requirements:
----------------------
              terraform {
                required_providers {
                  aws = {                             --> Local name for provider
                    source  = "mycorp/aws"
                    version = "~> 1.0"
                  }
                }
              }

A module intended to be used as the root of a configuration — that is, as the directory where you'd run terraform apply — 
should also specify the maximum provider version it is intended to work with, to avoid accidental upgrades to incompatible new versions. 
The ~> operator is a convenient shorthand for allowing only patch releases within a specific minor release:

            terraform {
              required_providers {
                mycloud = {
                  source  = "hashicorp/aws"
                  version = "~> 1.0.4"
                }
              }
            }

Do not use ~> (or other maximum-version constraints) for modules you intend to reuse across many configurations, 
even if you know the module isn't compatible with certain newer versions. Doing so can sometimes prevent errors, 
but more often it forces users of the module to update many modules simultaneously when performing routine upgrades. 
Specify a minimum version, document any known incompatibilities, and let the root module manage the maximum version.



alias: to work with Multiple Provider Configurations
-----
You can optionally define multiple configurations for the same provider, and select which one to use on a per-resource or per-module basis. 
The primary reason for this is to support multiple regions for a cloud platform

                    # The default provider configuration; resources that begin with `aws_` will use
                    # it as the default, and it can be referenced as `aws`.
                    provider "aws" {
                      region = "us-east-1"
                    }

                    # Additional provider configuration for west coast region; resources can
                    # reference this as `aws.west`.
                    provider "aws" {
                      alias  = "west"
                      region = "us-west-2"
                    }
